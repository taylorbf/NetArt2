### Exercise 1:

Create a piece of computer art using the terminal
Use "live coding" the terminal as your interface
Record the performance with as a screen capture.
*It can be simple -- remember that even adding and removing a folder is content.*
This is intended as a challenge. Goals:

- how can a low-level computer actions be used for art?

- practicing a performance is a good way to get muscle memory with commands.


### Exercise 2:
Once a day this week, practice git with the following actions:
- create a repo
- pull it to your computer
- commit a file
- create a new branch called 'dummy'
- merge that branch back into the master branch
- delete the repo
