# Week 1: Befriending the terminal and git

### Exercise 1:

Create a short piece of computer art using the terminal. Use "live coding" the terminal as your interface. Record the performance with as a screen capture.

*It can be simple -- remember that even adding and removing a folder is content.* It's a chance to try to exploit low-level computer actions be used for art. And, practicing a performance is a good way to get muscle memory with commands.

Some places to start are [a command line primer](http://lifehacker.com/5633909/who-needs-a-mouse-learn-to-use-the-command-line-for-almost-anything) and [a terminal cheatsheet](https://github.com/0nn0/terminal-mac-cheatsheet/wiki/Terminal-Cheatsheet-for-Mac-%28-basics-%29) but feel free to explore other resources you find on the net.




### Exercise 2:

Read [git, the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

Delete your github app! Then, once a day this week, practice command line git with the following actions:

- create a repo
- pull it to your computer
- commit a file
- create a new branch called 'dummy'
- merge that branch back into the master branch
- delete the repo
