# Week 4

Read Chris Wilson's article on timing in web audio, [A Tale of Two Clocks](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/audio/scheduling/)

Install [Firefox dev edition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Developer_Edition) and activate web audio dev console

Look at:
- [Tone.js](https://github.com/TONEnoTONE/Tone.js/), a synthesis/sample/effects library
- [Lissajous](http://lissajousjs.com/), a nifty live coding tool
- [Meyda](https://github.com/hughrawlinson/meyda), a web audio analysis / visualization tool
- [Web Audio Tool](http://www.webaudiotool.com/app/?#)
- [Patchwork](http://www.patchwork-synth.com/)
- [WAAX](http://hoch.github.io/WAAX/)
- [List of online analog synth impersonations](http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/virtual-instrument-web-browser/)

Reflect: How do these tools [have different goals, expect different users, afford different amounts of control, help or hinder creativity], and how do they [use similar underlying audio paradigms, relate to computer music techniques]

#### Project (2+ weeks)
Create a library / tool relating to web audio. (...or web art, in which case we should revise links above). This can be as big or small as you like and consume as much or little of the rest of the semester as you like.

First, brainstorm:
- What do you want your library to contribute? 
  - i.e. making a Tone.js clone may not be useful (or, it may be, if you use different syntax, presets, interface).
  - Maybe it doesn't need to be a standard oscillator, samples, effects library.
- How can it be useful to you?
  - Maybe emphasis on live sound input & manipulation?
  - Maybe a library of Tone.js + nexusUI modules that can be routed together?
  - Maybe a sound visualization library?
  - Granular Synth library or granular extension to an existing library?
  - Maybe focus is on enabling networked sound specifically?

Think about this: the analog synth paradigm is 70 years old. What do digital media, web browsers, networks, html5 graphics, laptop interfaces, etc, offer sound? (If this is a good time to look at socket.io also, we can do that)
