# Week 2: Navigating a js module + object-oriented interfaces

Review [JS objects](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Introduction_to_Object-Oriented_JavaScript) if necessary. This is a big read, but worth it.

### Exercise:

- Fork [NexusUI](http://www.github.com/lsu-emdm/nexusui) on github 
- Switch to the *dev branch* in your fork (that's where we develop)
- **Add your own interface.** Think hard about what you want this to be! How do you want to interface with music? Do you want to embrace or avoid skeuomorphism?
- **Important notes:** Do not work in the /dist/nexusUI.js file. Instead, work in the /lib folder. Use an existing widget as a template. Also, be sure to look at /lib/widgets/index.js and add your interface to that list as well so that gulp looks for it.
- Ask questions as needed about project structure. See the readme about how to make custom builds of the project as you develop, using gulp.

Once you have completed your interface:
- Build the project
- Send a pull request to the main lsu-emdm fork
- Attach a few sentences in the pull request: How does nexusUI take advantage of object-orientedness?
