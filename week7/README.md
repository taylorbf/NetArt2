# Week 7 : Demo Site

- Make it slick.
  - [Typedrummer](http://typedrummer.com/) is a good example of a simple, clean demo page.
  - [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) is your friend.

- GitHub Pages is a good place to host, because you can push updates directly from your repo with one command.
  - Give your project an index.html
  - Make a branch called gh-pages
  - Your page will now be accessible at http://yourname.github.io/projectname/
