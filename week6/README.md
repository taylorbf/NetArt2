# Week 6+  --  Documentation

## Software

Get [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/) (pronounce latek) and a LaTeX editor. For Mac, I use [TeXworks](http://sourceforge.net/projects/texworks.mirror/).

Get [BibTex](http://www.bibtex.org/) or similar.

Conference paper writing is its own art, both in medium/technicals and in content.

LaTeX is like a programming language for writing papers. The primary advantage to it is that you can download a template that will format your paper according to the very specific guidelines of the conference proceedings. You don't have to do much more than fill in your own text.

BibTex will let you easily add references to your paper. Basically, you store all of your references in a .bib file, and then you can use them in any paper. E.g. When I start a new paper, I link to my .bib file, then I can write \cite{Taylor:NexusUI} and it will automatically add an endnote for my NexusUI paper. No retyping or reformatting. Pretty sweet.

You can also usually get a Microsoft Word conference template, but you are much more likely to mess up or override the default formatting as you type your paper because Word is a big mess. Additionally, you have to write in all of your citations. Blegh.


## Content

- **clarity:** just explain what it is, don't get fancy, enthusiastic or dramatic.
- **avoid vague hyperboles** like "the possibilities are infinite"
- **admit the faults** of your project. this is research and everyone is learning.
- **good video** documentation
- take time to highlight the aspects that especially seem cool
- good review of history w/ citations. i would search NIME proceedings, ICMC, JSTOR, etc, for papers on Gendy and Xenakis.
- in fact, I've been told it's best to **start with citations, images, and an outline** of 'what it is'. then fill in the gaps by describing the images**
- if you can come up with some way to 'test' or **'verify' your results**, that is excellent.



## Audiovisual Documentation

Many paper reviewers will tell you that this is the most important part. If you submit an HD video that very clearly communicates your project, your reviewer will have a much easier time understanding your paper. (And may be skimming your paper anyway, although they *shouldn't*.) 

This is true of images/photos as well -- have lots of good ones. Even if your project has no visual manifestation, be creative and invent a few clear pictographic representations of the inner workings of your project. If your project is musical, a photo of a performance might also help.
