Get [BibTex](http://www.bibtex.org/) or similar

Conference paper writing is its own art, both in medium/technicals and in content.

LaTeX is a like a programming language for writing papers. The advantage to it is that you can download a template that will format your paper according to very specific guidelines of the conference proceedings. You don't have to do much more than fill in your own text.

BibTex will let you add references to your paper easily. Basically, you store all of your references in a .bib file, and then you can use them in any paper. E.g. When I start a new paper, I can just say link to the .bib file, and write \cite{Taylor:NexusUI} and it will automatically add an endnote for my NexusUI paper. No re-typing / re-formatting. Pretty sweet.

You can also usually get a Microsoft Word conference template, but you are much more likely to mess up or override the default formatting as you type your paper because Word is a big mess. Additionally, you have to write in all of your citations. Blegh.


## Content

More on this soon...



## Audiovisual Documentation

Many paper reviewers will tell you that this is the most important part. If you submit an HD video that very clearly communicates your project, your reviewer will have a much easier time understanding your paper. (And may be skimming your paper anyway, although they *shouldn't*.) 

This is true of images/photos as well -- have lots of good ones
